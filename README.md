# 🚀 RE: Active-Negative-Loss-Functions

## 🎨 Original Work
Explore the groundbreaking work at [Virusdoll's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Virusdoll/Active-Negative-Loss/tree/main).

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Python** >= 3.9
- **Torch** >= 1.12.1
- **Torchvision** >= 0.13.1
- **Numpy** >= 1.23.1

## 🛠️ Changes Made
We've wielded our coding wand to enhance `utils.py`:
- ✨ Added conditions for loss functions `nce` and `nnce`.
- 🛠️ Squashed the pesky MAE error.

## 📊 Reproduced Results
Marvel at our scientific endeavors in the "experiment" folder.

**Tables Regenerated:**

## 📈 Reproduced Graphs
Behold the visual symphony we've composed:

To summon these magical graphs:
1. 🧙‍♂️ Navigate to the desired folder.
2. 🪄 Cast the spell by executing `Graphgen.py`.

For example, to conjure the graph of ANL_CE on CIFAR10:
- 🌌 Venture into the `anl_ce_cifar10_graph` realm.
- 🌟 Invoke the Python file.

Additionally, we offer tensorboard support (with credit to the original authors):
1. 🚀 Launch tensorboard with `tensorboard --logdir=runs\cifar10\sym\anl_ce`.
2. 🌈 Witness the creation of wondrous graphs.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
We extend our deepest gratitude to the visionary creator, [Virusdoll](https://github.com/Virusdoll/Active-Negative-Loss/tree/main). Your brilliance lights our path! 💫
